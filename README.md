- 👋 Hi, I’m @treejayryan
- 👀 I’m interested in everything. I'm an IT recruiter (booooo! I know), but I am genuinely curious in learning about programming/scripting languages for my own leisure AND so I can better serve both my clients and job candidates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT language. I am learning the differences between programming languages and scripting languages. I am learning about libraries and frameworks. I am learning about cloud computing. If it is IT, I am trying to learn it. But please understand I am only five weeks in as of 11/04/2021, so I am very much a rookie.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing (so far!). I am pretty clueless right now, but I hope I can help way down the road once I gain some experience and basic knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me ... hopefully on here, if at all possible. Otherwise, I am @treejayryan on most social media platforms.
